**The Pain:** The finance team spends hours drafting invoice reminder emails and looking up which invoices are overdue.

**The Exercise:** An agent that drafts (or sends) emails based on the actual account status.

**Flow:**
1. The user asks the Agent: “Give me a summary of Trey Research’s outstanding balance and draft an email requesting payment for invoices over 30 days past due.”
2. Copilot Studio: Queries the Customer Ledger Entry table in BC, filters by Due Date, and sums amounts.
3. Uses Generative AI to write a formal but friendly email, inserting invoice numbers and exact amounts.
4. Output: Displays the draft in the chat or sends the email.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft account with appropriate licenses
- Access to Copilot Studio (https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)
- Admin or maker permissions in your environment

   - **Password**: the assigned password
4. Complete multi-factor authentication (MFA) if prompted

## Step 2: Use this prompt
